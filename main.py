# I saw an exercise on the internet asking you to create a program
# which would take an input from the user (a number from 1 to 9) and
# as output would display a list of super prime numbers (numbers that
# are prime and, at the same time, that all its digits are prime). Those
# super prime numbers must be presented in ascending order, and must
# have a certain number of digits (such number of digits being the number
# entered as input).

list_a = ["3", "5", "7"]
list_b = ["0", "2", "3", "5", "7"]
